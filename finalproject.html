Parallel and Distributed Final Project
Chase Brown
Downloading and running the sequential and CUDA CNN programs on Heracles
Step 1.
Log into your heracles account on the cu Denver network.
From the file directory you wish to download the project run
    $ git clone https://github.com/BroChase/cuda_CNN.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/BroChase/seq_CNN.git
This will create two directories /cuda_CNN and /seq_CNN in the directory you ran the git clone. The data files are large and unable to store them on github. These files can be downloaded and uploaded to Heracles. There will be 4 files in the data folder. These are the train and test files from the edited Faces in the Wild dataset.
Data files : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yt0P7SjDS95Juyit9bhNYeOKVE5jbgJ4?usp=sharing

The file structure on Heracles should look like below


In both the cuda_CNN and seq_CNN folders simply run make in the terminal.
    $ make
This will make the executable CNN in the cuda_CNN directory and CNN_TEST in the seq_CNN directory.
Simply run them ./CNN and ./CNN_TEST to test the programs.
