* at least one reference (plus URL link)
* briefly describe the overall system architecture

* programming languages it supports
* compare and contrast the key features of the machine with what we have covered in class
* date the machine was built
* is it still in use
* what type of applications does it support
* operating systems (if information available)
* what type of interconnection network does it have

The CM-5 Connection Machine. This is a scalable homogeneous multiprocessor design capable or different sized randing from 32 processors to 1024. It also does not use a bus like in a conventional computer and allows for its bandwidths to increase in proportion to the number of processors. Scaling up to 16384 processors the architecutre allows for a modular component design. The data network design of the CM-5 incorporates both point-to-point communication of data and broadcast and synchronization.
* Programming languages it supports
The CM-5 supports multiple languages. They include Fortran 77, High-performance Fortran 90, C*, Lisp, and Id. The idea between supporting multiple languages is the idea that no one model of parallel programming will solve all users needs.
* Compare and contrast the key features of the machine with what we covered in class.
Key features that we had discussed about this super computer are relating to the CM* machines. The architectures that we have talked about from the lectures and reading material relate to hypercube architectures such as that in the CM-2. The CM-5 architecture changed it architecture to a fat tree node design that allows for easier programming much like a SIMD device.
* Date the machine was built
Announced in 1991 it was built and became the fasted supercomputer in the world in 1993.
* Is it still in use
The CM-1 CM-2 and CM-5 computers are no longer in use and are on display in multiple museums.
* What type of applications does it supports
The macine was designed for applications involved in high-energy physics, global climate modeling and geophysics, astrophysics, linear and nonlinear optimization, computational fluid dynamics, and megnetohydrodynamics, electromagnetism, computational chemistry, computational electromagnetics, computational structural mechanics, materials modeling, evolutionary modeling, neural modeling, and database search , etc.
* Operating systems (if information available)
* What type of interconnection network does it have
The CM-5 was announced to replace the CM-2â€™s hybercubic architecture to a MIMD architecture based on what is called a fat tree network.
