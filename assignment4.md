#### The CM-5 Connection Machine. MIMD-Shared Memory using fat tree.

The CM-5 Connection Machine. This is a scalable homogeneous multiprocessor design capable or different sized randing from 32 processors to 1024. It also does not use a bus like in a conventional computer and allows for its bandwidths to increase in proportion to the number of processors. Scaling up to 16384 processors the architecutre allows for a modular component design. The data network design of the CM-5 incorporates both point-to-point communication of data and broadcast and synchronization.

The CM-5 ran on an operating system called CMost, it was a Sun-based UNIX OS designed for multiple users to be able to use. The system supports multiple languages. They include Fortran 77, High-performance Fortran 90, C*, Lisp, and Id. The idea between supporting multiple languages is the idea that no one model of parallel programming will solve all users needs.

Key features that we had discussed about this super computer are relating to the CM* machines. The architectures that we have talked about from the lectures and reading material relate to hypercube architectures such as that in the CM-2. The CM-5 architecture changed it architecture to a fat tree node design that allows for easier programming much like a SIMD device.

Announced in 1991 it was built and became the fasted supercomputer in the world in 1993. The CM-1 CM-2 and CM-5 computers are no longer in use and are on display in multiple museums.

The macine was designed for applications involved in high-energy physics, global climate modeling and geophysics, astrophysics, linear and nonlinear optimization, computational fluid dynamics, and megnetohydrodynamics, electromagnetism, computational chemistry, computational electromagnetics, computational structural mechanics, materials modeling, evolutionary modeling, neural modeling, and database search , etc. The CM-5 was announced to replace the CM-2’s hybercubic architecture to a MIMD architecture based on what is called a fat tree network.

#### The C.mmp computer with MIMD and shared memory using crossbar switch.
The C.mmp computer was designed as an early MIMD that used shared memory via a crossbar switch that would connect the Compute modules in the system.
While many of the architectures that we have discussed in class including mesh and hyper. The architecture of the C.mmp used a 16x16 crossbar switch, a very old method used to connect the processors or Computer modules together to form the shared memory MIMD.

This machine was developed in 1971 and is no longer in use… Being one of the original MIMD designs it used PDP-11 minicomputers as processing elements. The main application use focus for this architecture was to use the PDP-11 minicomputers in a parallel architecture for artificial intellegence.

The operating system that it used was called HYDRA. It was an object oriented multi-user operating system. It was capable of using a subset of the language called ALGOL 68. The OS and most applications that ran on the system were written in Bliss-11.
